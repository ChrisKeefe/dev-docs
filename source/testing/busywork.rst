Global CI (Busywork)
====================

All "official" QIIME 2 plugins, interfaces, and user-documentation are tested
and built using an in-house build system known as `Busywork`_. The current
state of the development versions of all QIIME 2 packages can be viewed 24
hours a day, 7 days a week there. The source repository for `Busywork`_ can be
found at https://github.com/qiime2/busywork. Developers interested in having
their plugin built there should first consult the :doc:`Publishing a Plugin
<../publishing/index>` documentation to learn about the requirements necessary
for integration with this build system.

.. note:: While there is no "official" definition of what makes a QIIME 2
   plugin "official", for now we are considering plugins that are maintained as
   part of the https://github.com/qiime2 organization (and subsequently, built
   and maintained by the QIIME 2 development team) to be official QIIME 2
   products.  This definition might change in the future.
