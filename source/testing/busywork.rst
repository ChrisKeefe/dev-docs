Global CI (Busywork)
====================

All QIIME 2 plugins, interfaces, and user-documentation are tested and built
using an in-house build system known as `Busywork`_. The current state of the
development versions of all QIIME 2 packages can be viewed 24 hours a day, 7
days a week there. The source repository for `Busywork`_ can be found at
https://github.com/qiime2/busywork. Developers interested in having their
plugin built there should first consult the :doc:`Publishing a Plugin
<../publishing/index>` documentation to learn about the requirements necessary
for integration with this build system.
